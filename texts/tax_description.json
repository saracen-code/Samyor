    "Welcome to the Bureau of Taxation, Your Excellency, Egden {king}. You stand in a grand office, surrounded by towering shelves filled with ancient scrolls, dusty ledgers, and the faint scent of ink and parchment. The flickering light of a lone candle casts shadows on the stone walls, and the distant sound of scribes at work echoes through the cold, vast chambers. The air is thick with the weight of history, and before you lies the **Tax Management System**, a tool essential for maintaining order and prosperity in the kingdom. The scent of leather-bound books and freshly inked quills fills your senses as you prepare for the day’s decisions.",
    
    "Greetings, Noble Ruler, Egden {king}. Within the stone-clad walls of your grand office, a cold breeze sweeps through the towering windows. Ancient tomes and parchments line the walls, their pages yellowed with age, and the dim glow of sunlight illuminates the grand oak desk before you. The air is thick with the whispers of the past, as your hand rests on a parchment, quill in hand, ready to make choices that will shape the future of your realm. The **Tax Management System** lies before you, its presence a reminder of the kingdom’s vast wealth and responsibilities. The murmur of distant servants can be heard as the faint scent of ink and burning wood fills the room.",
    
    "Your Majesty, Egden {king}. The flickering firelight casts long shadows on the stone walls of your chambers. Piles of ledgers, scrolls, and quills fill the vast wooden desk, where only the faint scratch of a quill can be heard as you pour over the kingdom’s finances. The walls, adorned with tapestries of ancient battles and family crests, tell the story of your lineage. The **Tax Management System** sits at the center of the room, its leather-bound pages waiting for your attention. A soft crackling from the hearth fills the otherwise quiet space, as outside, the winds howl against the stone walls of the castle, yet inside, all is calm as you consider the kingdom’s future.",

The stone walls are covered with maps of your lands, and the fire in the hearth crackles softly, casting a warm glow over the room. Before you lies the **Tax Management System**, a powerful tool that helps maintain order within your domain. The sounds of quills scratching against parchment fill the air as your subjects await your commands.",
